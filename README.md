# StarNavi | test project

For fully using this application, you have to install some packages which are written in requirements.txt file, run this file with help of pip install -r requirements.txt command.

After installing all libraries from requirements.txt, you can use application whatever you feel like do:
* Write `python manage.py runserver` for running the server;
* Launch `automated_bot.py` to let bot starts (You should run the server firstly).

* Admin's username: admin
* Admin's password: admin123

<<<<<<< HEAD

Added a new version of the bot: multiprocessing.

* Additional: If you have a weak computer, there is a huge chance that something will be wrong with the bot. So, I would recomend you to use bot from the 20th commit, if you have a weak computer, of course. The bot in the 20th commit is consistent and the bot in the 21st commit is parallel.
