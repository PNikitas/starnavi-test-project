# StarNavi | test project

For fully using this application, you have to install some packages which are written in requirements.txt file, run this file with help of pip install -r requirements.txt command.

After installing all libraries from requirements.txt, you can use application whatever you feel like do:
* Write `python manage.py runserver` for running the server;
* Launch `automated_bot.py` to let bot starts (You should run the server firstly).
