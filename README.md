# StarNavi | test project

For fully using this application, you have to install some packages which are written in requirements.txt file, run this file with help of pip install -r requirements.txt command.

After installing all libraries from requirements.txt, you can use application whatever you feel like do:
* Write `python manage.py runserver` for running the server;
* Launch `automated_bot.py` to let bot starts (You should run the server firstly).

* Admin's username: admin
* Admin's password: admin123

---

Added a new version of the bot: multiprocessing.

* Additional: If you have a weak computer, there is a huge chance that something will be wrong with the bot. So, I would recomend you to use bot from the 20th commit, if you have a weak computer, of course. The bot in the 20th commit is consistent and the bot starting from the 21st (better use the last commit if you want bot is parallel) commit is parallel.
